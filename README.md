# Classification-Approach-for-Time-Granular-Traffic-in-SDWMN-
Abstract

WMN(Wireless Mesh Network) is a wireless network for the communication in
which nodes or systems are connected in a mesh topology. The inter-connection of all
nodes or systems connected with all other systems is called mesh topology. In the modern
Wireless IoT(Internet of Things) devices, WMN is mostly used because of its efficiency. SDWMN is the result of employing SDN(software Defined Networking) technology in
the WMN . This kind of SDN and WMN combination provides the advantage of creating
a Heterogeneous large wireless network. These large wireless networks increase the
efficiency of the IoT networks. There are also disadvantages in the SDWMN network because of
heterogeneous(different types of nodes) networks. These heterogeneous large wireless
networks will create a problem of varying granular network traffic. These things cause
congestion in the network and packet transfer speed will become slow. TE(Traffic
Engineering) is a method of optimizing the performance of telecommunication networks
by dynamically, predicting, analyzing, regulating the behavior of the data transmitted
over the network. TC(Traffic Classification), it is used to classify the network traffic based on
different factors and TC is also used in various applications like intrusion
detection,firewall building,status report generation ,etc. This paper uses different kinds of
ML(Machine Learning) techniques to classify the network traffic to avoid congestion. All
ML Algorithms reached the accuracy above 95%.Boosted Gradient Descent classifier
provides the best accuracy(above 98.8%) of all other ML techniques. 10-fold cross- validation technique is used to validate the model and to avoid overfitting. KEY WORDS: ML classifier, Traffic Classification, WMN, SDN, Traffic Engineering,
